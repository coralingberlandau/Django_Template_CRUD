# Template Django

    Backend in Django and Frontend in HTML and JavaScript without CSS.

    This is a general framework, that can be worked on and additional 
    data can be added as required. In the example here in the template, 
    the theme is a library, but it can be changed according to the needs,
    and subject of the project.

    Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additions!

# Begin:

    1. You need to activate the virtual environment.

    2. Install the requirements.
    for example to Mac : pip3 install -r Requirements.txt 
    To other computers: pip install -r Requirements.txt

    3. After that, run the program. for example to Mac:
    python3 manage.py runserver.
    To other computers:  python manage.py runserver.

    4. You can delete the data in the db file and 
    write your own data from scratch. It will work.


    Enjoy and good luck!
